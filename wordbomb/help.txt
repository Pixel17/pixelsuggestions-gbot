Word Bomb for Glisterbot was adapted from https://jklm.fun/ "BombParty"

Word Bomb consists of a series of rounds in which each player, one by one, is prompted with a two or three letter phrase. The players must name a valid word or phrase/name which contains the prompted phrase.

If you fail to name a valid word, you will lose a life. After you lose your last life, you are eliminated (you lose).

You may notice a bar containing all the letters of the alphabet underneath the prompted phrase. Each time you succesfully match a word, each letter present in that word is erased from the alphabet bar. If you manage to use all 26 letters, the alphabet bar resets and you recieve an extra life.

At the end of the round, the winner's score is calculated base on the number of players involved, the difficulty setting, the time per round, and the number of lives the winner had left over. You can view your score or someone else's score at any time using `/wordbomb_stats [Optional: Member]`.
